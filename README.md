## Welcome
This is just a small demo project for the LawVu website. I only used minimal testing to avoid taxing the production site without authorisation.

1. Download project
2. In your command line: npm install
3. In your command line: npx playwright test or npx playwright test --ui

## Used in project
1. Playwright latest version at time of creation: 1.46

3. Github for version control and Github Action
